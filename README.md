# ðŸŒŸHow to Run the code?
## Step 1
### Clone the project's repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IT3R4/envoy-web-app.git
```
## Step 2
### Go to the project's directory
```bash
cd Project101
```
## Step 3
### Create/setup a environment. 
(this is optional since venv is also included in th repo.. just in case you're required to set up the environment)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
## Step 4
#### You can skip step 3 since venv is already included with the file. Just open it on VScode and tap F5 to run the code. Make sure to select Python as a interpreter.
